                <h2>What is CharitABLE?</h2>
                <div>CharitABLE is a non-profit, public, charitable organization that operates out of Chapel Hill, North Carolina with the aim of providing aid and support to the homeless, hungry, impoverished and less fortunate individuals living in the community. The organization operates through the donations and funding of the public, and all benefits are put towards our various endeavors in providing food, water, clothing, shoes, shelter, and medical supplies to the less fortunate. We were founded in the year 2010, and since then have provided millions of our ‘nourishment packages’ (including a week’s supply of food and water, clothing, and shoes) to individuals in need in our area, as well as opened various shelters across the Chapel Hill/Carborro area in which we have hundreds of volunteers working day and night to provide aid, support and a comfortable place to live for those who may need it.</div>

                <h3>OUR SERVICES</h3>
                <h5>Food & Water Supplies</h5>
                <p>Through the donations of the public, our volunteers work to put together packages and containers of healthy and nutritious meals, snacks and drinks that we then distribute to various locations in the area. These packages are typically enough for a family to eat comfortably for a week, and upon request we do take into account allergies and preferences.</p>
                <h5>Medical Supplies</h5>
                <p>Through the donations of the public, our volunteers gather up medical supplies such as band-aids, thermometers, hand santizer, flashlights, gauze, dental supplies, first-aid kits, etc. We then group these supplies into packages and distribute them accordingly.</p>
                <h5>Clothing and Shoe Distribution</h5>
                <p>Through the donations of the public, as well as through thrift shops, clothing drives and lost-and-found areas, our volunteers collect and distribute any and all clothing that is clean and usable to any in need of it within the area.</p>

                <h5>A word from our incredible volunteers...</h5>
                <div>"Working at CharitAble was one of the most rewarding and fulfilling experiences of my life. It felt so great to give back to my Chapel Hill community. Not only did I get to help those in need, but the working environment was so friendly, open and diverse that it did not feel like any work at all. It was great to be surrounded by other volunteers who just want to give back to their community. I cannot recommend volunteering with CharitABLE enough!" - John Hancock, Student Volunteer Summer 2021
                </div>
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <div>"I have been a part-time volunteer with CharitABLE for the past two years. This experience has taught me so much about CharitABLE's key values of empathy, honesty, respect and compassion. My favourite part about working with CharitABLE is connecting with the families that we help. It is so important to remember that these are people just like you and I who have fallen on hard times and are deserving of our compasion and respect. It is so fulfilling to be able to help these families get back on their feet. - Sarah Barnes, Part-time volunteer 2020-present</div>
